### Background
This is my third independent project since I began learning how to program in spring 2018.

One of my goals for 2018 has been to make headway in working my way through reading the backlog of books in my personal library. When reading, I like to note every word that I am unfamiliar with and look it up in the dictionary. That served as the inspiration and impetus for Lexical Amplifier, and developing it was a great way to expand and strengthen my programming skills.
